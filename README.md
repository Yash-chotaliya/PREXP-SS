### Description

Developed with the support of Google Gemini.

Our ExpAlert App is designed to help users keep track of the expiry dates of their products. Users can add various items such as groceries, medications, cosmetics, and more to the app along with their respective expiry dates. The app will then notify users when a product is about to expire, allowing them to take necessary actions such as consuming the product before it expires or purchasing a new one.
